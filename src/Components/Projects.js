The dynamic field engine allows the same system to adapt to multiple business domains without code changes.  
With its unified overview panels, detailed payment history, and theme-based UI, ABC serves as a solid foundation for small to mid-scale business management. The dashboard and analytics layer are planned as the final enhancement.`

            The RRR system was built to replace the manual, paper-based process traditionally used for managing staff accommodations in railway divisions, which was time-consuming and prone to errors. By providing a digital, centralized system, RRR streamlines tracking staff room occupancy and staff arrivals/departures.

            One of the project's standout features is the visual occupancy map, where room statuses are clearly marked by color, enabling quick assessment by station operators. This feature reduces the time required to allocate rooms and helps avoid double-bookings or errors in manual logs.

            The admin panel’s flexibility allows for multiple stations and buildings to be managed from a single interface, making the tool useful not only for Bilaspur but also scalable to other divisions. The ability to download data in Excel format supports offline record-keeping and auditing, while the peak arrival tracking gives management valuable operational insights to improve resource planning.

            Overall, the project significantly reduces administrative overhead, improves accuracy in accommodation management, and provides actionable data analytics to railway authorities.

            The IRWSI (Indian Railway WebsiteS Information) platform was built to help departments, especially within government or large institutions like the Indian Railways, organize and share resources, websites, and documents more effectively.

            While similar to Glance in functionality, IRWSI introduces a few powerful enhancements — such as admin-locked profiles, a specialized document reader, and immersive page flipping for Drive-hosted documents. This prevents accidental edits and elevates the document viewing experience for the user.

            The platform is ideal for internal teams curating training material, policies, or external resources, with clean sharing and strong content control. Through admin curation, branding consistency, and modern visuals, IRWSI ensures utility and reliability while delivering an engaging UX.

            Features like flip animation, zoom/search in docs, public sharing, and admin-lock protection make IRWSI not just a bookmark manager — but a presentation-ready knowledge platform.

        This is a feature-rich, highly customizable school management platform. It supports every phase of the academic process, from admission to promotion. The design includes theme switching, grid/list view toggles, and animations for a modern user experience. Admins can configure everything from master data (school name/logo) to academic settings like subjects, exams, fee structures, and payment tracking. Excel and PDF tools allow for downloadable receipts, reports, and history. The backend supports advanced academic logic like setting multiple exams per class, associating subjects with those exams, and managing year-end promotions. Dropout students are tracked, and TCs are auto-generated. With its clean UI and robust backend, SSS is ideal for modernizing school operations with full administrative control.

                    This project detects bike riders, helmets, and number plates using a YOLOv8 model integrated into a Streamlit web app. It identifies whether a rider is wearing a helmet or not and performs OCR on detected number plates. Ideal for traffic monitoring and safety enforcement systems.
